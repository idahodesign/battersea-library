Subject: Adaptive Header
Context: Building [an adaptive header for Battersea Library v2.2
Goal: Provide an adaptive header component within the Battersea library. The header component is to be compatible with the other components in the library particularly the smooth scroll function code 
Please review the existing library structure and propose a design for this component following the Battersea patterns.
Request: Can we please build the adaptive header component.  The component should include three elements
An optional post header bar content area that can may a secondary menu and variety of html content. This height of this element is statice but customisable however the display of the element can be configured based on the device.
The main header needs to include an adaptive branding area with the ability to change to a mobile specific logo when viewed on mobile devices.
The header needs to include an optional navigation area. The reason for this is There are a number of navigation options I would like to develop and be compatible with the header. In addition to the traditional horizontal multileveled navigation with drop downs I would like to include the option for a vertical menu that can be located either on the left or right of the browser window and a overlay menu that appears when a button is clicked with the menu displayed on a semi transparent background over the entire browser window All navigation options need to be adaptive to the screen and use a mobile option when displayed on mobile devices. The layout of the header should be configurable and accommodate the horizontal menu justified to the right of the branding area or the branding area and navigation to be centre aligned with the logo above the menu

If the header is optionally set to remain at the top of the page, the component containing the brand and navigation area should shrink as the user scrolls down the page. The header's height transition should be smooth and include a resizing of the logo.
