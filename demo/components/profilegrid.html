										<p>He is particularly good at explaining hard technical problems in plain language. He runs an internal mentoring programme and speaks at local meetups about building resilient distributed systems.</p>

										<p>Sofia spent a decade in academia before realising she wanted her research to land somewhere other than a journal shelf. She joined Northbank in 2020 and now leads a small team that helps organisations make sense of messy, contradictory data.</p>
										<p>Her background in behavioural economics gives her an unusual perspective on user research. She has a knack for spotting the question nobody thought to ask.</p>

										<p>He joined Meridian in 2021 and works mainly with their healthcare clients, where getting the details right genuinely matters. He is also an occasional illustrator and has had work featured in It's Nice That.</p>

										<p>Before Helix, she worked in events management, which taught her that the best plans always need a good contingency. She is calm under pressure and direct when she needs to be.</p>

										<p>Originally from Stockholm, he moved to London in 2018 and still gets mildly annoyed about the coffee. He mentors junior developers and runs the team's fortnightly code review sessions.</p>
